URL Shortener:

This application is written primarily in nodejs.  It uses npm as its package manager.  I didn't use a database because I wanted it to be simplistic and easier to use by having less dependencies.  The datasource for this app is a JSON file, records.json.  I chose a JSON file as the datasource because it's easy to read/write.  I am aware that having a JSON is in no way a good way to scale, but this is a simple implementation.  If I were to use a DB, I'd use Mysql and the knex library that's easily installable through npm.

Assumptions:
1) I assumed the users will enter the protocols when entering the URL.  This makes it easier to do redirects without having to check the validity of the URl.

Install:
1) Run "npm install" in the parent directory (where index.js is)

Run:
1) Run "node index.js"
2) Open a browser to "http://localhost:9000"
3) Enter in URLs with the protocol http/https
4) Go to Short Urls generated to be redirected, i.e. http://localhost:9000/1

Unit Test:

I built my own test.js script to run the "miscellaneous" functions.  It output pass/failed tests for each function within the misc.js module.

1) Run "node tests/test.js"
